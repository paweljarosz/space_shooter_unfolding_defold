# Space Shooter - Unfolding Defold - Game development tutorial

This project was created from the "empty" Defold project template and proceeded with the instructions from the tutorial series "Defold Space Shooter" on YouTube cahnnel of Unfolding Gamedev: [https://www.youtube.com/@unfolding_gamedev](https://www.youtube.com/@unfolding_gamedev)

After the tutorials the project was cleaned up, structurized and enemy movement was added to `enemy.script` in `init()` function.

Happy Defolding!
